README for testing the PDA class.
---------------------------------

Attention!
	When passing a xml file to the executable as a parameter, DON'T add the postfix '.xml'
	So instead of this: ./pda examplePDA0.xml, write ./pda examplePDA0
	This is very important for the generating of the right name for the dot file.
	The output will be a textfile in dot language and a png image representing the PDA.
	Example: After parsing the file examplePDA0.xml, you get examplePDA0.dot and examplePDA0.dot.png
